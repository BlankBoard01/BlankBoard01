# Satyaa

I build things. Mostly around IoT —  
but I also enjoy working with web, servers, automation, and a bit of design.

## Focus

- Embedded systems (Arduino / Espressif)
- MQTT-based communication
- Sensor-driven automation
- Web-based control & monitoring
- Server configuration & system setup

I like connecting hardware to backend systems and making them stable enough to run in the real world.
