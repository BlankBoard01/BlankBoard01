# Satyaa

I build things. Mostly around IoT —  
but I also enjoy working with web, servers, automation, and a bit of design.

## Focus

- Embedded systems (ESP8266 / ESP32)
- MQTT-based communication
- Sensor-driven automation
- Web-based control & monitoring
- Server configuration & system setup

I like connecting hardware to backend systems and making them stable enough to run in the real world.

## What I Enjoy Exploring

- IoT architecture & reliability
- Network fundamentals
- Linux environments
- Automation workflows
- Clean and simple interface design
